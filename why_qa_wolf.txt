Okay so I went a step further and made it into an actuall playwright "test" this can be ran by following the steps:
> yarn install
> yarn playwright install --with-deps
> yarn playwright test

Use your installer of choice if you aren't using yarn.

* Note you can still do your node index.js to get the same results.

I have also setup a github repo for this if you want to see my merge history. (It's not quite up to my standards, but it is close)
